8. Gesture Recognition: Focus on the Hands
    - A novel architecture with focus of attention channels
    - The architecture consists of a separate channel for every focus region (global, left hand, right hand) and modality (RGB, depth, RGB flow and depth flow). 
    - A novel sparse network architecture for fusing channels.

9. A neural network based on SPD manifold learning for skeleton-based hand gesture recognition
    -  skeleton-based
    - symmetric positive-definite matrices (SPD) manifold
    -  learns a SPD matrix from a set of SPD matrices and maps the resulting SPD matrix, which lies on a Riemannian manifold, to an Euclidean space for classification.
